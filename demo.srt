00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:27,970
他放学后要送我去上班的地方
He's giving me a ride to my job after school.

152
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,360
我在肯德基工作
I-I work at KFC.

153
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,550
海米  我在教关于暴政的寓言
Jaime, I'm-I'm teaching an allegory on tyranny,

154
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:32,480
如果你不立刻把手机收起来的话
and you'll know the meaning of that

155
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,050
你就知道那是什么意思了
if you don't put that away right now.

156
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,380
-好  -现在  调成静音
- Okay. - Now, put it on silent.

157
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,380
好的
All right.

158
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,440
谢谢你  玛蒂娜
Okay, thank you, Martina.

159
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:44,460
安东
Anton.

160
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,980
玛蒂娜刚才读的那一段
The passage Martina just read,

161
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,120
声响器等于在说
where Squealer is basically saying,

162
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,010
"我们也想让你自己决定
"We'd love to let you make your own decisions,

163
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:53,000
可我们不能这么做  因为你的决定可能是错的"
but we can't because you might make the wrong decisions,"

164
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,110
能谈谈你对这句话的看法吗
you want to tell us what you make of that?

165
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,330
不
No.

166
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,580
快说吧  我们都想听
Come on. We'd all love to hear.

167
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,890
那很抱歉了
Sorry for y'all.

168
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:08,470
好吧  我理解  这段很难
Okay, I get it. It's a tough passage.

169
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:10,430
那  我们把这段话拆开来看
So let's, um... let's break it down.

170
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,920
我说了  我不想
I said I don't feel like it.

171
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,270
我知道你不想
I know you don't feel like it,

172
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:16,100
但我想让你参与课堂讨论  好吗
but I want you to participate in the class, okay?

173
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:17,700
所以我想让你读
So I'd like you to read it.

174
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:20,150
这样也许能加强你的理解
And you might understand it better.

175
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:21,820
来  读这一段
Come on, read the passage.

176
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:22,880
你来读
I want you to do it.

177
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,370
你要参与进来
You need to participate.

178
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,050
我没开玩笑  安东
I mean it. Anton...

179
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:27,220
我说了  不要
I said no.

180
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,800
威尔逊校长  有什么事吗
Principal Wilson, how can we help you?

181
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,830
不用管我
Don't mind me.

182
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,430
好吧
Okay.

183
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,560
那好  我们刚才读到声响器说的话
Okay, so, we were looking at, Squealer's quote.

184
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,670
他想表现得善良一些
Well, he's trying to come across as benign,

185
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,530
可他并不善良  对不对
but he isn't, is he?

186
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,800
他是怎样的
What is he?

187
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,210
没关系  这个问题很难
No problem. It's a tough question.

188
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:03,240
当我们遇到难题
When we get a tough question,

189
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,560
在书中总是能找到答案
we go back to the book for the answers.

190
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,310
海米
Jaime.

191
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,300
可索洛维先生说了没关系
But Mr. Solloway said it was okay.

192
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,730
-我没这么说过  -你说了
- No, I did not say that. - Yes, you did.

193
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:19,780
-你怎么这样  -我没说
- Come on, man. - No, I didn't.

194
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,000
这是我教学的方法...
No, it was a pedagogical...

195
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,230
就是我教学的方式...
It was a... A teaching thing. It was...

196
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:28,430
拉莫斯先生  你放学后可以来我办公室取
Mr. Ramos, you can retrieve it at the end of the day from my office.

197
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:29,180
帮帮忙  索洛维老师
Come on, Mr. Solloway.

198
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,270
我们不是朋友吗
I thought we were friends.

199
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,970
海米是想联系他哥哥
Jaime is trying to contact his brother

200
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:34,520
好让他哥哥放学后来接他
who is giving him a ride to work after school.

201
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:37,320
海米是独生子
Jaime is an only child.

202
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,820
没血缘关系的哥哥不行吗
Brother from another mother?

203
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,050
那你带着你的手机
I think you and your phone

204
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:44,110
跟我去办公室吧  走吧
can spend the rest of the day with me. Let's go.

205
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:52,180
盖特伍德先生  把兜帽摘掉
Mr. Gatewood, take down that hood.

206
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,050
谢谢
Thank you.

207
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,920
贾内尔在我的课上也是那么干的
Janelle does that to my classes, too, man.

208
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:16,990
总是半路坐进来
Always sitting in.

209
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:19,080
我可是从一开始就在这所学校任职了
And I've been at this charter since the beginning.

210
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:21,340
抱歉  我又不会了
Sorry. I'm lost again.

211
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:22,270
你想做什么
What are you trying to do?

212
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,400
想把测试成绩录入进去
Trying to record the grades from this quiz.

213
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,560
回到主页
Go back to your home page.

214
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,980
点那个键
Click on that tab.

215
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,510
然后就能进成绩录入界面了
That'll take you to your grading landing page.

216
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:31,500
谢谢
Thank you.

217
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:33,490
抱歉  我以前上课时
Sorry. We didn't really have any of this

218
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:34,540
没用过这么先进的玩意
last time I was teaching.

219
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,790
猜到了  你比上一个
I'll bet. You're a lot older

220
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,660
跟我同办公室的老师年纪大不少
than the last guy I shared this room with.

221
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:43,210
我该担心贾内尔吗
So, should I be worried about Janelle?

222
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:49,350
说实话  我觉得她在矫枉过正
To be honest, I think she's overcompensating.

223
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:52,900
因为她自己明白  雇用她是平权之举
Because she knows her hiring's an act of affirmative action.

224
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:55,790
别往心里去  我妻子说
Look, never mind. My wife says I'm not allowed

225
00:10:55,790 --> 00:11:00,540
我不能再发表这样的言论了  就当你没听过
to say things like that anymore, so just, forget it.

226
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,060
我想问你个写作的问题
Let me ask you another writing question.

227
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:08,560
你第一篇手稿写好以后
When you finished your first manuscript,

228
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:11,550
是怎么出版的
How did you get it out there?

229
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:11,550
{\an8}输入新成绩

230
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,340
我在读研时接触了很多人
well, you make a lot of contacts in grad school.

231
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:17,350
{\an8}安东·盖特伍德  RD

232
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:19,350
乔尔  RD是什么意思
Joel, what does "RD" Mean?

233
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:21,220
意思就是他要重修该课
It means the kid's retaking the class.

234
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,430
预修语文不是高年级的课程吗
I thought AP English was only available to seniors.

235
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,540
安东·盖特伍德
Anton Gatewood?

236
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:31,350
他去年春天就该毕业了
He was supposed to graduate last spring.

237
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,120
可是在第二学期时抄袭
Plagiarized in the second semester,

238
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,770
所以贾内尔让你的前任老师挂掉了他
so Janelle made your predecessor fail him.

239
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:38,480
现在这孩子就得重修一年
Now the kid's gotta take the whole year again.

240
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,770
我问你个问题
So let me ask you a question.

241
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:47,110
你还有经纪人吗
Do you still have an agent?

242
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:48,630
但愿有吧
Hope so.

243
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,440
几个月前给他寄了份手稿
Sent him a manuscript a couple of months ago.

244
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:59,060
{\an8}《东帕萨迪纳》

245
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:03,290
你看你能不能帮我...
You think there's any way you could, uh...

246
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,460
快点开啊
Go, go, go!

247
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,460
{\an8}海伦

248
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,980
我是海伦  请留言
It's Helen. Leave a message.

249
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,110
是我  我这车堵住不动了
It's me. I'm completely stuck in traffic.

250
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:30,230
只有半英里的路
It says I'm a half mile away

251
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:32,650
但可能要开个四十分钟
but it's gonna take 40 fucking minutes, so just tell...

252
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:35,270
跟特雷弗说我会到的  好吗
just tell Trevor I'll be there, okay?

253
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:43,460
先生  您要去哪里
Sir. Can I ask where you're going?

254
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,290
抱歉  我来晚了
Sorry I'm late.

255
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:45,820
我儿子在这里读书
My, son is a student here.

256
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:47,180
特雷弗·索洛维
Trevor Solloway.

257
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:50,420
叫什么
Name?

258
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:52,860
我的名字吗
What, my name?

259
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,900
我是他爸爸  诺亚·索洛维
I'm his father, Noah Solloway.

260
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:58,860
没有
Nope.

261
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,370
"没有"是什么意思
"Nope"? What do you mean, "Nope"?

262
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,030
就是名单上没有你的名字
Nope, you're not on the list.

263
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,520
你有校园卡吗
Do you have a school I.D.?

264
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:07,660
我该去哪办

265
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,840
在网上
It's online, sir.

266
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,830
进入学校的家长必须要登记
Any parent wanting access to the grounds needs to register.

267
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,550
加里森先生太太  你们好
Mr. And Mrs. Garrison. How are you?

268
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,850
你好  请进
How's it going? Come on in.

269
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,030
现在来不及了  能不能给我张临时的
Okay, look, I can't do that, so can I get a temporary one?

270
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,660
-能用这里的卡吗  -不行
- Can I take one of these? - Nope.

271
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,820
我儿子在里面
Look, my son is in there.

272
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,330
先生  没有通行证的话你不能进去
Sir, I cannot let you through without a pass.

273
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:27,020
想象一下  如果我让你进去了
Can you imagine if I let you in

274
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:29,750
而你的前妻对你有限制令
and your ex has a restraining order out against you

275
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,530
今晚是她跟孩子在一起的时间

276
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:35,660
你怎么知道是离婚了

277
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,060
瞎猜的
Wild guess.

278
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:41,020

287
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:26,240

00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,030
诺亚  我没想到你能来
Noah, I didn't think you could make it.

290
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,520
不  我们谈过这个  海伦
No, we talked about this, Helen.

291
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,850
你在这里干什么
What are you doing here?

292
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,900
你没告诉特雷弗我要来
You didn't tell Trevor I was coming?

293
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,970
别在孩子面前这样
Let's not do this in front of the kids.

294
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:46,120
对不起  什么样
Sorry, do what?

295
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,660
我们今早说好了
We talked about this this morning.

296
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:48,870
周末也说过了
We talked over the weekend.

297
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,950
-我已经把这个写进了日程  -好吧  抱歉
- This was in my calendar. - Okay, well, sorry.

298
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:53,300
我错了  我搞错了
I made a mistake. I got confused.

299
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,130
我们...  我们发生了很多事  所以
We just have... we have a lot going on, so...

300
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:56,210
不  我不是挑事
No, I'm not... I'm not making a thing of it.

301
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:57,960
只是我被卡在这了
It's just that I was stuck out here.

302
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,180
名单上也没有我
My name wasn't on the list.

303
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,210
听起来真的是个无心之过
Looks like it was an honest mistake.

304
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:03,800
我没说不是  我只是...
I'm not saying it wasn't. I'm just...

305
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:12,180
我知道  我只想让孩子们看到我来了
I know. I just wanted to show the kids that I was here.

306
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:15,180
我也确实来了
That I am here.

307
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:17,180
知道了  爸
Message received, Dad.

308
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:28,250
这样吧  一起吃晚饭
Look, come to dinner.

309
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:30,950
我们要去墨西哥餐厅
We're going to Mexican.

310
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:33,220
你也一起来
You should come.

311
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,580
是啊  爸爸
Yeah, Dad.

312
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:36,490
你应该一起来
You should come with us.

313
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,360
抱歉我迟到了
Sorry I'm late.

314
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:59,250
-爸  -你好  爸爸
- Dad. - Hi, Dad.

315
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:03,220
我坐这吗  这张椅子有人坐吗
Should I sit there? Is this taken?

316
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:04,790
谢谢
Thanks.

317
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:08,120
我把导航输成洛杉矶
I put, Los Angeles into the GPS

318
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,600
而不是圣塔莫尼卡  所以...
instead of Santa Monica, so...

319
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,360
圣塔莫尼卡和洛杉矶完全不同
Santa Monica's a whole different city.

320
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,250
你会熟悉的  只是需要点时间
You'll figure it out. It just takes time.

321
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,620
请给我一杯玛格丽塔  不加盐
Can I get a margarita, please, no salt?

322
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:20,830
谢谢
Thanks.

323
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:27,740
孩子们  猜猜我上周末都花时间装了什么

327
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:35,440
希望你们最近可以有时间过来过夜
so hopefully you can come for a sleepover sometime soon.

328
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,370
我可以去玩一天
I'll come over for a day,

329
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:40,110
但我不能在那过夜
but I don't think I'm gonna sleep over.

330
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:41,250
为什么
Why not?

331
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:44,330
托潘加峡谷很吓人
Topanga Canyon's creepy.

332
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,980
托潘加有什么吓人的
What's creepy about Topanga?

333
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:51,070
妈妈告诉她查尔斯·曼森在那里住过
Mom told her Charles Manson lived there once.

334
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:51,070
{\an8}美国著名连环杀手

335
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:54,350
是真的
He did.

336
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:01,200
你怎么知道查尔斯·曼森的
How do you even know who Charles Manson is?

337
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,760
我本来不知道  后来我在油管上看了他的视频
I didn't, and then I YouTubed it.

338
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:05,940
多谢了
Thanks a lot.

339
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:11,500
你呢  小特
How about you, Trev?

340
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,230
过夜  就你和我
Sleepover, just you and me?

341
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,890
他的周末行程已经满了
His weekends are kind of packed.

342
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:21,080
听听他的意见
He can speak for himself.

343
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:22,450
可以吧
Well, I mean,

344
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:25,340
我们可以商量个时间  爸爸
yeah, we can try and get something on the calendar, Dad.

345
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,960
好吧  那就商量个时间
Okay, something on the calendar.

346
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:31,670
妈  维克  我想跟你们谈谈驾校的事
Mom, Vik, I wanted to talk to you guys about drivers' ed.

347
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:32,950
好吧  但是
Okay, but... So--

348
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:34,710
还是再过六个月吧
maybe we'll wait six months?

349
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:37,110
不不不  我马上就15岁了
No, no, no, I'm gonna be 15 so soon, and, you know,

350
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:38,250
比别人先学是件好事
it's good to get a head start.

351
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,300
能把那杯玛格丽塔给我了吗
Can I get that margarita, please?

352
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,020
教师之夜
So, what happened...

353
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,470
教师之夜怎么了
what happened with teacher night?

354
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,130
课程之夜吗
Curriculum night?

355
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:46,330
非常非常顺利  对吗  小特
It went really, really well, right, Trev?

356
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:47,100
对
Yeah.

357
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,520
真的很希望那晚我去了
I really wish I had been there.

358
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,060
我想看你在做什么
I wanted to see what you were doing.

359
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:52,120
他就是跟我们说更多
He was just telling us more about the project

360
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,200
他在他们所学单元中研究的项目
he's working on in the unit they're studying.

361
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:55,700
什么项目
What's the project?

362
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,640
有个女孩
Yeah, so there's this girl,

363
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,630
住在殡仪馆里
and she lives in a funeral home.

364
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:00,950
是本书还是...
Is it a book or...

365
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,270
是一本漫画小说
It's a graphic novel.

366
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,470
那个女孩觉得她  可能是
And the girl thinks that she might be...

367
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,520
同性恋  不止是觉得
Gay. But not just thinks.

368
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:09,660
她就是同性恋
She is gay.

369
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,990
她长大后
And as she grows up,

370
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:13,470
开始发现她爸爸也是同性恋
she begins to realize that her dad was gay, too,

371
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:14,750
但没有出柜
but closeted.

372
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,070
你这个项目的搭档是布鲁克林吗
And your partner on this is Brooklyn?

373
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:18,930
不好意思  布鲁克林是什么
Sorry, what's Brooklyn?

374
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:20,980
是个人  还是...
Is that a... Is that a person or...

375
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,820
布鲁克林是个男孩
Brooklyn's a boy.

376
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:27,910
好吧  这么说布鲁克林是你的朋友
Okay, so... so Brooklyn's your friend.

377
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:30,530
我没搞懂是怎么回事
I-I don't understand what's going on.

378
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:33,300
课程之夜真的很有意思
Curriculum night was definitely interesting.

379
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:39,120
那么  在特殊单元中
And so, uh... Yeah, so, um, in the special unit,

380
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,000
我们会拿上我们选好的漫画小说
we then take our chosen graphic novel

381
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,890
研究塑造书里世界观的
and study the social issues

382
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:45,210
社会问题和历史
and history that make up its worldview.

383
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:49,210
在你这情况中  是同性恋权益吗
And in this case, it would be gay rights?

384
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,950
没错
Exactly.

385
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,020
这本漫画小说是什么
What is this graphic novel?

386
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:53,950
《开心窝》
Fun Home.

387
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:53,950
{\an8}女同题材音乐剧

388
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,120
开心...  那不是音乐剧吗
Fun... Wasn't that a musical?

389
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:59,120
对  就是百老汇的那部
Yes, on Broadway, actually.

390
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,730
话说回来  真是个很酷的学习方式
Anyway, it's a really cool way to learn.

391
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,830
是啊  我想知道的是  小特
Yeah. Okay, what I was wondering, Trev,

392
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:08,030
我想知道  你是不是有什么
is, um... I was wondering, is there anything

393
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:11,790
想告诉我们
you're trying to express

394
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,870
或跟我们交流的
or communicate to us,

395
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:17,230
关于你选择的这个题材
with your choice of material?

396
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:19,170
因为我希望你知道
Because I hope that you know

397
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:23,890
我们爱你的一切  接受你的一切
we love and accept everything about you,

398
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,430
不管你是什么样子
whatever you are.

399
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,410
我知道
Yeah. I know.

400
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:32,330
你的每一部分
Every part of you.

401
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:33,660
我知道
Yeah, I know.

402
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,950
海伦  能借一步说话吗
Helen, can I get a word, please?

403
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:36,900
好
Sure.

404
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,750
不好意思
I'm sorry.

405
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,110
刚才那是怎么回事
What's going on out there?

406
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:45,890
他和那个男孩形影不离
He's been inseparable from this boy.

407
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:47,240
-布鲁克林吗  -对  布鲁克林
- Brooklyn? - Brooklyn, yes.

408
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,930
这件事我也怀疑了好久
And it's something I've suspected for a long time,

409
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:50,650
-现在终于...  -什么
- and now finally... - What...?

410
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:52,560
他是同性恋  诺亚
He's gay, Noah.

411
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,230
等等  所以...
Wait. So...

412
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:56,980
所以我刚才看见的是你...
So, what I was seeing out there was some kind of...

413
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,350
你在想办法让他承认吗
some kind of attempt to make him say that?

414
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,350
我真的真的希望你参加了课程之夜
I really, really wish you had been to curriculum night.

415
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:06,510
是啊  我真的努力过了
Yeah, I-I really tried.

416
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,750
我说不好
Look, I don't know.

417
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,960
在我看来这是显而易见的
It just seems to me very obvious.

418
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,680
你应该看看他的作品
You should see his art.

419
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,530
还有这个孩子  布鲁克林
And then this boy, Brooklyn.

420
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:15,940
甚至是他的...选题
And even his choice of... of material.

421
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,480
一目了然
It's-it's just plain as day.

422
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,810
好吧  首先  他才14岁  海伦
Okay, okay, first of all, he's 14, Helen.

423
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:23,190
也许...也许他在进行一些探索
Maybe... maybe he's exploring things,

424
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:25,100
不过现在还为时过早
but it's way too early

425
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,980
让他去承认一些...
to try to get him to confess to some--

426
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:29,510
他几乎要说出来了
Look, it was on the tip of his tongue.

427
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:31,560
不骗你  他正打算说出来的
I swear to you, he was about to say it.

428
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,230
真的吗  真的是这样吗
Was he? Really, was he?

429
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:34,350
还是你在诱导他
Or were you leading him?

430
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:37,120
因为我看到的是你明显在诱导他
'Cause what I saw was you were definitely leading him.

431
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:39,410
真是荒唐
This is ridiculous.

432
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:42,350
难道比你在墨西哥餐馆
More ridiculous than trying to

433
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:44,010
设法逼你儿子出柜还要荒唐吗
out your son in a Mexican restaurant,

434
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:45,120
他可能根本就不是同性恋
when he might not even be gay?

435
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:46,710
他是同性恋  不如这样吧
He is gay. And hey, guess what.

436
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:47,390
我有个想法
I have an idea:

437
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,600
不如你干脆承认这件事让你不舒服
Why don't you just admit you have a problem with it?

438
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,480
就算他是同性恋  我也没问题
I don't have a problem with it, if he is.

439
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:53,200
-他就是同性恋  -好吧
- He is. - Okay, fine.

440
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,440
不过  何时何地出柜
But shouldn't it still be his choice

441
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,580
难道不该由他自己来决定吗
as to when and where he wants to come out?

442
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,410
我就是这个意思
That's what I'm saying.

443
00:20:57,410 --> 00:20:59,160
他正要承认  可你打断了
He was about to, until you walked in.

444
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,320
你让他害怕
You intimidate him.

445
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,950
海伦  你为什么要这么做
Helen, why are you doing this?

446
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,160
做什么
Doing what?

447
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,640
我大老远搬过来
I move all the way out here--

448
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,200
是的  为了和孩子们在一起
Yeah, to be with the kids, right?

449
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,450
我没让他害怕  也没让史黛丝害怕
I don't intimidate him or Stacey.

450
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:12,860
我只是对他们不再了解了
I just don't know them anymore.

451
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,170
所以我才会来
That's why I'm here.

452
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,550
而你在想方设法
And you're doing everything in your power

453
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:18,610
把我挡在他们的生活之外
to box me out of their lives.

454
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,380
知道我以后不会再做什么吗
You know what I'm not doing anymore?

455
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:21,520
这个
This.

456
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,510
抱歉
I'm sorry.

457
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,210
艾莉森  我是诺亚
Alison, it's Noah.

458
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:53,250
很抱歉这么晚了还打给你
sorry to call so late.

459
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,420
只是想问候一下
Just checking in.

460
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,330
好的  再见
Okay, bye.

461
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,020
麦克斯
Max,

462
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:16,670
我是诺亚
it's Noah.

463
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,730
信不信由你
Believe it or not.

464
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:20,880
我...
I'm, uh...

465
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,460
就是想问候一下
just reaching out.

466
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:25,180
希望你一切都好
Hope you're well.

467
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,400
再见
Bye.

468
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:38,520
{\an8}斯大林主义  资本主义
乔治·奥威尔《动物农场》中的权力腐化
作者  安东·盖特伍德

469
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,950
安东·盖特伍德

周三开始  准备讲《荒原》
Beginning Wednesday, get ready for The Waste Land.

471
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:26,280
安东
Anton.

472
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:27,710
请等一下
Hold back, please.

473
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:29,240
我得去搭便车
I gotta meet my ride.

474
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,850
你朋友可以等一等
Your ride can wait a minute.

475
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:41,920
我想和你聊聊你的论文
I want to talk about your essay.

476
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,570
论文怎么了
What about it?

477
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:50,570
论文...
It's, uh...

478
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:54,180
写得非常非常非常好
it's very, very, very well done.

479
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:55,970
是吗
Is that right?

480
00:24:56,810 --> 00:25:00,170
是的  你对于小说思想的分析
Yeah. Your analysis of propaganda in the novel

481
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:04,430
以及论述如何通过操控语言来...
and showing how language can be manipulated to...

482
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:06,950
行使权力  不仅仅是好
wield power, it's-it's not just good.

483
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,870
而是...精彩绝伦
It's... it's brilliant.

484
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,360
好吧
Okay.

485
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:17,030
你想说的就这些吗
So, is that what you wanted to talk about?

486
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:19,750
是的
Yeah.

487
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:21,610
真的真的很好
It's really, really good.

488
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:23,810
所以  我想知道
So, what I want to know is

489
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,520
论文是谁写的
who wrote it?

490
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,920
你什么意思
What do you mean?

491
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:30,910
就那个意思
Just what I said.

492
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:34,880
这篇精彩的论文是谁写的
Who wrote this brilliant essay?

493
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:36,940
因为我觉得不是你写的
'Cause I don't think it was you.

494
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,280
为什么
Why not?

495
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,580
证据如下
Well, let's look at the evidence.

496
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,150
你拒绝参与课上的内容
You refuse to participate in class.

497
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:46,080
你就坐在那里
You just sit there

498
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,420
头趴在桌子上  还戴着兜帽
with your head on the desk and your hoodie up.

499
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:50,790
是啊  也许是因为你讲的课太烂了
Yeah, maybe 'cause your class fucking sucks.

500
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,420
你我都清楚你有过抄袭的历史
We both know your history of plagiarism.

501
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:57,310
你认为你要是再被发现会落得什么下场
What do you think would happen if you got caught again?

502
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:59,870
如果我现在就带着这个直接去找威尔逊校长
If I went straight to Principal Wilson with this right now...

503
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:01,060
你觉得很好笑吗
You think that's funny?

504
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,500
你觉得你的前途很好笑吗
You think your future is funny?

505
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,410
不是的
No, man.

506
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:04,740
我觉得你很好笑
You funny to me.

507
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:05,850
为什么呢
Why is that?

508
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:12,320
好吧
Okay.

509
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,270
那么这句引用呢
How about this quote?

510
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:17,910
"其他动物都说声响器可以把黑的说成白的"
"The others said that Squealer could turn black into white."

511
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:20,970
好的
Okay.

512
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,060
给我解释解释这句话
Explain to me what that means.

513
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:34,280
在小说当中  声响器代表
So, in the novel, Squealer represents

514
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:36,770
专制国家培养的宣传机器
the propaganda machinery that despotic states develop

515
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:38,990
用来控制底层动物
in order to control their populace.

516
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,060
斯大林统治时期  
Under Stalin,

517
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,050
这人是德米特里·谢皮洛夫
it was Dmitri Shepilov.

518
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:41,850
而在希特勒手下
Under Hitler,

519
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:42,990
这个人是戈培尔
it was Goebbels.

520
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,300
那句引用
And the quote,

521
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:45,250
"黑的说成白的"
"Turning black into white,"

522
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:47,070
就是声响器简单地说自己
is just a simplistic way of Squealer saying

523
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:49,470
能把恶行说成善举
that he can make evil sound like it was good.

524
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:52,950
奥威尔在《1984》中通过大洋国真理部
Orwell expanded on this idea in Nineteen Eighty-Four

525
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:54,450
进一步阐述了这一观点
with Oceania's Ministry of the Truth,

526
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:58,580
讽刺这个部门所做的一切都是骗人的
the irony being that all Ministry does is lie.

527
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:00,830
还有别的问题吗
Anything else?

528
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,210
安东
Anton.

529
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,250
安东
Anton.

530
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,680
安东  别这样
Anton, come on.

531
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,400
我应该向你道歉
I owe you an apology.

532
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,400
去你妈的
Fuck you.

533
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:16,670
{\pos(190,220)}第二话
海伦

534
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:41,820
他们是怎么上去的
How the fuck do they stay up there?

535
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:02,270
你在干什么
What are you doing?

536
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,490
没什么
Nothing.

537
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:16,890
你有什么困扰吗
Are you obsessing?

538
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:17,810
没有
No.

539
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,310
史黛丝  吃早餐了
Stacey, breakfast.

540
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:49,770
我要做完数学作业
I'm finishing my math homework.

541
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:53,450
你可以边吃边写
Well, you can finish it while you eat.

542
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,570
马上就好
Just a minute.

543
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:57,710
特雷弗  你音量能调小一点吗
Trevor, can you please turn that down?

544
00:29:58,590 --> 00:29:59,500
好的  妈妈
Sure, Mom.

545
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:01,860
到底是谁在给你发短信
Who's texting you, anyway?

546
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:02,760
布鲁克林
Brooklyn.

547
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:05,710
布鲁克林  是我们之前住的那一区吗
Brooklyn, as in our former borough?

548
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:06,780
不是  妈妈
No, Mom.

549
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:08,420
布鲁克林是我的朋友
Brooklyn's my friend.

550
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:12,120
短信发个没停
Well, that's a lot of texts.

551
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:13,680
怎么  她暗恋你吗
What, does she have a crush on you?

552
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,490
性别错了
Wrong gender.

553
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:15,680
布鲁克林是男孩
Brooklyn's a boy.

554
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,410
好吧
Okay.

555
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:22,720
看
Look.

556
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,610
我好像减了八磅
I think I've lost like eight pounds.

557
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:29,630
或许你该停止喝青汁了
Maybe you should lay off the green juices.

558
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,930
你今天不是打算放松吗
Thought you were going to relax today.

559
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:33,650
我很放松
Um, I am relaxed.

560
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:36,190
-史黛丝  -马上就好
- Stacey! - Just a minute!

561
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:38,720
我说了我会送他们上学
I told you I'd get them to school.

562
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,370
你明明可以多睡会  去做瑜伽
You could've slept in, gone to yoga.

563
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:41,980
忙完这个我就放松
Well, I'll relax right after this.

564
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,410
-我保证  -宝贝
- I promise. - Babe.

565
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:44,640
-干嘛  -过来
- Yeah? - Come here.

566
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,670
-不要  -过来
- No. - Come here.

567
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:47,540
该死
Oh, shit.

568
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,350
我手上沾满了蛋黄酱
I have mayonnaise all over my fingers.

569
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:51,150
你到底在担心什么
What are you so worried about?

570
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:53,030
-弄脏你的衣服  -海伦
- Staining your clothes. - Helen.

571
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,540
我没在担心任何事
I'm not worried about anything.

572
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,060
我们有一栋超棒的房子
We have an amazing house.

573
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,180
只剩下两个孩子
We're down to just two kids.

574
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,830
他们上学很开心
They're happy at school.

575
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,940
我们终于都收拾好了
We're finally all unpacked.

576
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:09,730
你答应过我  我们来这里时
You promised me, when we got out here,

577
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:11,020
你会放轻松的
you'd take it easy.

578
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,870
我真的很放松
And I seriously am...

579
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:15,010
很快就会了
going to.

580
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,310
-什么时候  -今天
- When? - Today.

581
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:18,730
主治外科医生乌拉
Chief Surgeon Ullah.

582
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:22,780
再说一遍
Say that again.

583
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:26,800
主治外科医生乌拉
Chief Surgeon Ullah.

584
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,090
你们俩
Guys.

585
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:29,920
恶心
Gross.

586
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,290
真扫兴
Buzzkill.

587
00:31:58,820 --> 00:31:59,760
海伦
Helen.

588
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,800
你还好吧
You okay?

589
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:04,490
嗯
Yeah.

590
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:05,410
没事
Fine.

591
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:08,910
好的
Okay.

592
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,970
火蜥蜴们  出发咯
Sollomanders, let's rock and roll!

593
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:16,300
史黛丝  快点
Yeah, Stacey, come on.

594
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,450
来了
Coming.

595
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,030
你查出她母亲是谁了吗
Have you figured out who her mother is yet?

596
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:44,640
我觉得她有点像女星米歇尔·菲佛  你觉得呢
Think she looks a little like Michelle Pfeiffer, you think?

597
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,750
还好
Not really.

598
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,270
吉娜·戴维斯呢
Geena Davis?

599
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,750
你干嘛不直接问她
Why don't you just ask her?

600
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:57,250
你干嘛不问  你老盯着她看
Why don't you? You spend so much time looking at her.

601
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:00,080
不  那是你  海伦
No, that would be you, Helen.

602
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,470
你想她到底知不知道
Do you think she even realizes

603
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,460
这些垃圾箱是她的  而不是我们的
these cans are hers, not ours?

604
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,330
我不认为
No, I don't.

605
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:13,810
你要是继续帮她搬  她永远不会知道
And she's not going to if you keep moving 'em for her.

606
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,430
你好
Hey there.

607
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:18,330
早上好
Good morning.

608
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:20,510
早上好
Morning.

609
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:23,080
那些是我的吗
Are those mine?

610
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,350
是的  不过别担心  我弄好了
Yeah, but don't worry about it. I got it.

611
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:29,870
告诉我
So, tell me,

612
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,210
你今天打算做什么来放松
what are you going to do to relax today?

613
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:33,340
去做心理辅导
Go to therapy.

614
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:34,760
那只会让你讨厌你妈
That just makes you hate your mother.

615
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:35,790
我本来就讨厌我妈
I already hate my mother.

616
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:38,210
再说  这不一样  这是西岸治疗方法
And besides, this is different. It's West Coast therapy.

617
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:39,310
很放松
Very chill.

618
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:44,980
-再见  -再见
- Bye. - Bye.

619
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:46,470
你们准备好了吗
You guys ready?

620
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:47,550
好了
Yep.

621
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:03,450
我的余额为负数
I've got a negative balance.

622
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:06,060
抱歉  你能再说一遍吗
I'm sorry. Uh, can you say that again?

623
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:06,880
我没听见
I didn't hear you.

624
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,990
我说我正站在学校餐厅的结账处
I said I'm standing here in checkout at the school cafeteria,

625
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:11,850
我饭卡里的余额是负数
and I've got a negative balance on my food card.

626
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:15,390
好的  这个月轮到你父亲充钱
Um, okay, well, it-it's your father's month to pay.

627
00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:17,020
你打过给他吗
Did you try to call him?

628
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:19,010
这么说你想让我挂掉电话  打给他
So you want me to hang up, try to call him,

629
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:20,650
然后等他回我电话吗
then wait around for him to call me back?

630
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:22,660
我想买好早餐去上课
I'm trying to get breakfast so I can get to class.

631
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,060
好的  宝贝  抱歉
Okay, sweetheart, I'm sorry.

632
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:26,660
我会处理好  给我三分钟  好吗
I'll-I'll take care of it. Give me three minutes, okay?

633
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:27,700
谢谢  妈妈
Thanks, Mom.

634
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,360
老天  诺亚
Oh, God, Noah.

635
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,200
你不是吧
I swear to fucking God.

636
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,910
那么
So, um,

637
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,040
我们试试观察你的身体
let's try scanning your body, huh?

638
00:34:37,890 --> 00:34:39,320
深呼吸
Take a deep breath.

639
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:42,040
观察你的身体
Scan your body.

640
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:44,350
告诉我你哪里感到压力
And tell me where you're feeling tension.

641
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,400
没有吗
Nothing?

642
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:02,360
我很好
I'm fine.

643
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,320
但今天早上
But this morning,

644
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,580
你以为自己感觉到地震
you thought you felt an earthquake?

645
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,040
没错
That's right.

646
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:12,550
很大的地震
A big one.

647
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:16,890
不如我们再观察身体一次
Why don't we try that body scan one more time?

648
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:18,570
卡普兰医生  抱歉
Dr. Kaplan, I'm sorry, I'm just really

649
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:20,690
我只是不习惯这样做治疗
not used to doing therapy this way.

650
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:21,970
在纽约我们会聊天
In New York, we-we talked.

651
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:23,760
我们不观察
We didn't scan.

652
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:27,280
你还想念纽约吗
You still miss New York?

653
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:30,480
越来越轻松了吗
Getting easier?

654
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:32,820
应该是吧
Um, yeah, I guess.

655
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,450
我想是的
I guess so. I guess it is.

656
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,480
我说不好  我就是觉得
I don't know. I just feel, um...

657
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:42,940
在这里不自在
...um, uncomfortable here.

658
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,640
这个城市让我感到不安全
This town, it makes me feel unsafe.

659
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:47,540
好的
Okay.

660
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,120
怎么个不安全法
Unsafe how?

661
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:52,350
比如  地震什么时候会发生
Well, like, for example, when's the earthquake gonna hit?

662
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,060
具体哪一次地震
Which particular earthquake?

663
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:57,260
大的那次  会把我们全杀死那一次
The big one. The one that's gonna kill all of us.

664
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:58,940
我们为什么
I mean, why are we all existing here

665
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:01,160
都待在这个断层线等死
on a fucking fault line just waiting to die?

666
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,570
你不觉得这很疯狂吗
Doesn't that seem insane to you?

667
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,430
好吧  我听到的是
Okay, so what I'm hearing is...

668
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:08,660
这座城市  这地方
this town, this place,

669
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:12,040
让你非常没有安全感
it really makes you feel unsafe.

670
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:16,260
对  我刚说了
Yes, I just said that.

671
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:19,030
但我现在觉得
Yes, but now I feel

672
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:22,090
我能理解你担心的级别
I understand the magnitude of your concern.

673
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:25,770
这是个地震笑话吗
Was that an earthquake joke?

674
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,740
不如我们再观察一次你的身体
Why don't we try scanning your body

675
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:28,510
看看是不是...
one more time just to see if we--

676
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:30,480
我觉得我儿子是同性恋
I think my son might be gay.

677
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:35,520
好吧
Oh, okay.

678
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:39,620
可能这就是你的地震
Perhaps there's your earthquake.

679
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,780
什么
What?

680
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,710
你极度惧怕的
The earthquake in your life

681
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:44,680
人生中的地震
that you so greatly fear.

682
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,030
这不是什么大事
I'm fine with it.

683
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:48,150
真的
I am.

684
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,160
我完全没有意见
I am 100% fine with it.

685
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,030
事实上我很高兴
I'm thrilled, actually.

686
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:52,700
我一直希望有个同性恋儿子
I always wanted a gay son.

687
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,820
我另外一个儿子就像加里·库珀
My other son is like Gary Cooper.

688
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,800
{\an8}好莱坞影星

689
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:56,620
真是糟透了
It's awful.

690
00:36:58,170 --> 00:36:59,290
为什么
It's awful because...?

691
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:01,120
我担心的是他的父亲
It's his father I'm worried about.

692
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:04,210
你儿子的父亲  你前夫吗
Your son's father, your ex?

693
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:06,960
对  他比较
Uh, yeah. He's not very, uh...

694
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:09,200
保守
tolerant.

695
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:14,700
我怕他会以为  这都是他的错
And I'm afraid he's gonna think it... it's his fault.

696
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,670
他的错
His fault?

697
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,610
因为特雷弗小的时候他不在他身边
For not being around when Trevor was young.

698
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:20,390
他离开了
For leaving us.

699
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:22,220
你担心你的前夫
You're afraid your ex-husband

700
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:23,820
会认为你儿子的性取向
will consider your son's sexuality

701
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:26,030
是他错误的人生选择所造成的
a result of his poor choices?

702
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:26,840
对
Yeah.

703
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,410
你当然知道  性取向可不是这么一回事
You know, of course, that's not how sexuality works.

704
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:36,300
我又没说我这么认为
Well, I didn't say I thought that.

705
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:39,140
我是说我担心他会这么认为
I said I was afraid he might think it.

706
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:45,380
你和诺亚之间怎么样了
Um, how are you and Noah doing?

707
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,410
上回  你对他来加州
Uh, last session, you were having

708
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:50,360
这件事抱有复杂的情绪
mixed feelings about his being out here at all.

709
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,230
很好  我们很好
It's fine. We're fine.

710
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:54,170
多见见他对孩子们有好处
Uh, it's-it's good for the kids to see him.

711
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:56,150
我对诺亚已经没有什么意见了
I don't have any problems with Noah anymore.

712
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:57,370
只是
It's just, uh... uh...

713
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:02,170
-怎么了  -他很烦人
- What? - He annoys me.

714
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:13,670
一谈到诺亚你就很不自在
You seem uncomfortable talking about Noah.

715
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:16,270
身体上的不自在
Physically uncomfortable.

716
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:17,500
你注意到了吗
Do you notice that?

717
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,900
海伦  请听我说
Helen, if I may.

718
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:26,790
你太过于依赖你的理智
I see you relying on your head a lot

719
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:31,020
去合理化甚至否认某些感情
to rationalize or even deny certain feelings.

720
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:34,180
你似乎没有意识到
You don't seem incredibly aware,

721
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:38,450
也没有心存感恩于这种智慧
appreciative of the intelligence,

722
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,940
经历
the experience,

723
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:42,460
创伤
the trauma

724
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:46,000
这些都藏在你身体里
that is hiding in your body.

725
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,260
什么创伤
What trauma?

726
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:55,020
你丈夫在结婚25年后
Uh, your husband left you abruptly

727
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:57,530
突然离开你
after 25 years of marriage,

728
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:01,940
然后开车撞了他新老婆的小叔
then hit his new wife's brother-in-law with a car,

729
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,230
逃离现场
fled the scene

730
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:06,640
最后为此坐了三年的牢
and ended up going to prison for three years.

731
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,450
与此同时
Meanwhile,

732
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:11,040
你的大儿子先后从两个高中退学
your older son failed out of two high schools,

733
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,570
差点没毕业
barely graduated,

734
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:14,730
你的女儿大学辍学
and your daughter dropped out

735
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:16,780
和年龄是她两倍  
of college to run off to Paris

736
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:20,010
还虐待她的男人跑去巴黎
with a man twice her age, who abused her.

737
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,870
你要这么说的话
I mean, well, when you put it like that...

738
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:32,940
我来加州时就全部翻篇了
I left all of that behind me when I came to California.

739
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:35,880
我现在真没什么好担心的
I have literally nothing to worry about right now.

740
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,070
惠特尼已经重返校园
Whitney's back in school.

741
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:41,310
她有个和她年龄般配的男朋友
She has an age-appropriate boyfriend who she likes.

742
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:42,650
我也很喜欢他
And I like him, too.

743
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:45,530
马丁在威廉玛丽学院也很开心
And Martin seems happy at William and Mary.

744
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:48,100
小朋友们也很喜欢这里的学校
And the younger kids really like school here.

745
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:51,040
维克的工作很棒
And Vik has an amazing job.

746
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,640
我们住在漂亮的房子里
And we live in a gorgeous house.

747
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,290
而且我的父母离我十万八千里远
Oh, and my parents are 3,000 miles away.

748
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:57,460
我不想工作就不工作
I don't have to work right now if I don't want to,

749
00:39:57,470 --> 00:40:00,050
每天都是大晴天  天天如此
and it's sunny every day. Every goddamn day.

750
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:03,080
都是大晴天  完美
Every goddamn day is sunny-- perfect.

751
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:05,180
但有时日晒让我觉得头疼
But you know what, sometimes the sun gives me a headache.

752
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:07,450
我还超讨厌大海
And I fucking hate this ocean.

753
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:09,740
-你讨厌太平洋  -对
- You hate the Pacific? - Yeah.

754
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:14,350
你靠它那么近时什么事都做不了
There's nothing you can do when you're around it

755
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:15,470
只能盯着它瞧
except look at it.

756
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:17,810
又大又蓝又扎眼
It's so huge and blue and obvious.

757
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:19,590
简直就是个戏精
It's like an attention whore.

758
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:22,050
太平洋是个戏精
The ocean is... is an attention whore?

759
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:24,370
你那么说  听起来我是个疯子
Okay, no, when you say it like that, it makes me sound crazy.

760
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:25,140
我不是那个意思
That's not what I was trying to--

761
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:26,350
我知道  算了  没关系
I know, but never mind. It's all right.

762
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:28,180
你理解不了的  算了
Just, you don't get it. Never mind.

763
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:38,130
我觉得这时就应该
You know, I think this would be a really good time

764
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:41,310
闭上眼睛
to just try closing your eyes

765
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,200
屏住呼吸
and holding your breath--

766
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,500
去死吧  埃泽拉
Fuck you, Ezra.

767
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:54,540
普丽娅
Priya?

768
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:57,720
我快弄完了
I'm almost done.

769
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:01,760
维克没跟我说你要来
Vik didn't tell me that you were coming over.

770
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,870
他跟我说他裤子总往下掉
He told me his pants are falling down,

771
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:05,510
所以我来改改
so I'm taking them in.

772
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:11,710
可以放着我来的
Well, I could have taken care of that.

773
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:13,380
你懂针线活吗
Do you know how to sew?

774
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:15,730
不懂  但我可以
No, but I could've, um...

775
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:18,580
送去别人那里
you know, dropped 'em off somewhere.

776
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:20,050
裁缝店吗
At a tailor's?

777
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,120
对
Yeah.

778
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:24,730
我就是个裁缝
I am a tailor.

779
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,190
我知道  我只是
I know. I just...

780
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:28,700
我不想麻烦你
I didn't want to bother you, so...

781
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:32,300
帮我自己的儿子有什么麻烦的
Why would it bother me to do something nice for my son?

782
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:35,640
你照顾你自己的孩子也会嫌烦吗  海伦
Does it bother you to care for your children, Helen?

783
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:39,850
你想喝点什么吗
Can I get you something?

784
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,270
家里有水  果汁
We have, um, water, juice.

785
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:45,430
应该也有苏打水
I think we have some club soda.

786
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,340
都是他爱吃的
His favorites.

787
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:51,630
印式炒茄子
Baingan bharta,

788
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:54,380
串烤鸡肉  炸脆松饼
chicken tikka, chole bhature.

789
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:57,610
我还买了印度面包  馕
I've even brought Indian bread-- naan.

790
00:41:57,610 --> 00:41:59,280
在冷冻层里
It's in your freezer.

791
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:00,460
别用烤箱加热
Don't put it in the oven.

792
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:02,160
会变得脆脆的
It'll get crusty.

793
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:03,750
放进微波炉
Put it in the microwave

794
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:06,090
再用平底锅加热
and heat it in a frying pan.

795
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:09,220
他可以把吃剩的带去单位当午餐
He can take the leftovers for lunch to work.

796
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,960
我真不知道该说什么了
I really don't know what to say.

797
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:15,720
也够你和孩子吃了
There's plenty for you and your children, too.

798
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:19,000
你真的没必要做这些
You really didn't have to do this.

799
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,160
冰箱里的食物
I mean, there's enough food in there

800
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,690
够吃一周了
for like, a week.

801
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:23,320
我不介意每个周日都这么做
I don't mind doing it every Sunday.

802
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,630
-我知道你忙  -没那么忙
- I know you're busy. - Well, I'm not that busy.

803
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:27,220
我有时间烹饪
I have time to cook.

804
00:42:30,490 --> 00:42:31,330
怎么
What?

805
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:33,940
维克拉姆太瘦了
Vikram is very skinny.

806
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:34,910
我知道
I know.

807
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:36,570
我觉得他压力太大了
I think he's stressed out.

808
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:38,680
新工作嘛
Um, about his new job.

809
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:39,890
也许吧
Perhaps.

810
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,260
也有可能他只是
Or perhaps he's simply not

811
00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:45,500
不太吃得惯你烧的菜
accustomed to the food you cook.

812
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:48,490
一个丈夫应该是胖胖的才对
A husband should be fat.

813
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,360
这说明他很开心
It shows he's happy.

814
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:56,600
我觉得维克挺开心的  普丽娅
Oh, I think Vik's happy, Priya.

815
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:00,900
我觉得  我让他挺开心的
I mean, I... I think I make him happy.

816
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:03,320
他是这么说的
That's what he tells me.

817
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:05,590
但男人除非有了自己的孩子
Of course, no man is truly happy

818
00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:08,200
否则不会真正地开心
until he has children of his own.

819
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:18,530
抱歉  我有些事要忙去了
Okay, will you excuse me? I have to do something.

820
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:45,130
-海伦吗  -是  你是谢拉对吧
- Helen? - Hi. Yes. Sierra, right?

821
00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:45,890
没错  我是
Yeah, that's right.

822
00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:47,070
你好吗
How's it going?

823
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:48,970
好极了  其实呢
Great, actually. I, uh...

824
00:44:48,970 --> 00:44:51,520
我一早上都在摘这个
I have been picking these literally all morning,

825
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,770
然后发现我从来都没
and I just realized that I-I never

826
00:44:53,770 --> 00:44:55,330
正式欢迎过你们  所以
really welcomed you guys, so...

827
00:44:55,330 --> 00:44:56,460
谢谢
Well, thank you.

828
00:44:57,130 --> 00:44:59,410
这个房间太美了
Wow, this room is great, by the way.

829
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:02,550
多谢夸奖  进来吧
Thanks. Uh, just... come in.

830
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:05,140
你的室内设计师是谁
Who's your, uh... who's your interior person?

831
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:06,920
我自己就是
Oh, I'm my interior person.

832
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:09,510
这么多牛油果
Wow, this is a lot of avocados.

833
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,060
对啊
Yeah. I, uh...

834
00:45:11,870 --> 00:45:13,670
我自己一个人肯定吃不完
I mean, I was never gonna eat all of those on my own.

835
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,770
但我妈的鳄梨酱食谱简直绝了
But my mom actually has this amazing guac recipe

836
00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:16,960
-她博客上有  -对了  你妈妈
- on her blog. - Oh, right, your mom.

837
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:18,410
她的博客叫什么名儿来着
What is the name of her blog again?

838
00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:20,020
我回头发给你
I'll send it to you.

839
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:22,140
你皮肤好好喔
You have amazing skin.

840
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:24,050
真的
No, seriously.

841
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:25,790
我刚想跟你讲一个面膜
Like, I was just gonna tell you about this mask

842
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:27,030
可以用牛油果做的
that you can make with the avocado

843
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:29,400
真的能把你皮肤里的毒素吸出来
that, like, literally sucks the toxins out of your skin.

844
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,480
-但我觉得你可能做过类似的了  -没呢
- But I feel like maybe you already do something like that. - No.

845
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:36,410
-你真是容光焕发  -多谢
- No, you're glowing. - Oh. Well, thank you.

846
00:45:39,490 --> 00:45:41,790
那  我走啦
Okay, well, um, I'll go.

847
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,930
-好  -我就想说
- Okay. - I-I did just want to say

848
00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:47,110
如果你需要人陪你健身
that if you ever wanted, like, you know, a workout buddy

849
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:50,280
或者喝酒  我都经常做这些
or a drinking buddy, I do both a lot.

850
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:51,560
好极了  谢谢
Great. Thank you.

851
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:55,950
-你试过山羊瑜伽吗  -没有
- Have you ever tried Goat yoga? - Goat Yoga? No.

852
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:59,100
-就是有小山羊陪着做的瑜伽  -真的吗
- Oh, my God, it's yoga but with baby goats. - Really?

853
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:02,290
没错  它们会用小蹄子揉你
Yeah! They, like, massage you with their little hooves.

854
00:46:02,290 --> 00:46:04,880
一起去做做应该会挺好玩的
So it might be fun if we wanted to do it together.

855
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:06,580
很感谢你
Well, thank you.

856
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:08,200
听上去不错  多谢了
That would be nice. Thanks.

857
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:11,100
你们搬来真是太让我开心了
I'm so glad that you guys moved in here.

858
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:15,540
真的  上一户人家真的
Really, because the last people were really...

859
00:46:16,490 --> 00:46:17,370
超冷淡
cold, you know.

860
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:19,920
他们有一种死气沉沉的气场
They had a very stagnant energy.

861
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:21,600
斯堪的纳维亚人嘛
They were Scandinavian.

862
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:24,650
但是你
But you...

863
00:46:27,470 --> 00:46:29,610
你的气质  怎么说呢
Your being is, like...

864
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,450
有一点儿
it's a little...

865
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:36,740
真的吗
It is?

866
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:40,470
我也说不好  以后会知道的
Yeah, I don't know. I-I guess we'll find out.

867
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:44,790
好啦
Okay.

868
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:52,670
再见
Bye.

869
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:09,310
学校不错啊
Nice school.

870
00:47:10,190 --> 00:47:11,210
明显是的
Apparently.

871
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:15,500
没有粒子加速器  我很失望
I am disappointed there's no particle accelerator.

872
00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:19,810
他们肯定会募集资金买一个的
I'm sure they'll have a... capital campaign to buy one.

873
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:25,740
也许他只是迟到了
Maybe he's just running late.

874
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:27,850
或许他找到更有趣的事做去了
Maybe he found something better to do.

875
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:31,370
你为什么还让他影响到你
Why do you still let him get to you?

876
00:47:34,350 --> 00:47:35,470
我也不知道
I don't know.

877
00:47:42,770 --> 00:47:44,140
特雷弗在那里
There's Trevor.

878
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:55,640
你们是特雷弗的父母吧
You're Trevor's parents, aren't you?

879
00:47:55,950 --> 00:47:58,180
-我是...  -你们的儿子太棒了
- Uh, well, I'm-- - You guys have such a wonderful son.

880
00:47:58,180 --> 00:47:59,810
听到没有  维克
Oh. Did you hear that, Vik?

881
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:01,740
我们有个特别棒的儿子
We have a wonderful son.

882
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:02,670
谢谢你
Thank you.

883
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:05,290
我们也是这么认为的
Yeah, we really think so, too.

884
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:07,530
你们知道布鲁克林吧
And you guys, of course, know Brooklyn.

885
00:48:07,530 --> 00:48:09,620
我们听说过他的一些事
Um, we know about Brooklyn

886
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:12,250
对本人不是特别了解  不过是的
more than we know him, but yes, of course.

887
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:13,610
他们简直像个连体婴
They're joined at the hip, those two.

888
00:48:13,610 --> 00:48:15,490
完全难分难舍
Totally inseparable.

889
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:18,330
我希望你们了解
Which... I want you guys to know,

890
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:20,020
我们各方面都完全支持他
we totally support here in every way.

891
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:21,270
这里很包容很安全
This is a safe environment

892
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:24,090
特雷弗可以充分表达自我
in which Trevor can fully express himself.

893
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:26,510
不管怎样  很高兴见到你们
Anyway, great to see you,

894
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:27,780
也很高兴有特雷弗这样的学生
and great to have Trevor with us.

895
00:48:27,790 --> 00:48:29,540
他真的很特别
He's truly special.

896
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,250
多谢
Thanks.

897
00:48:40,490 --> 00:48:41,980
所以他是同性恋吧
So he's gay, right?

898
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:43,630
显而易见
As the day is long.

899
00:48:44,770 --> 00:48:47,280
你觉得那孩子是真的独立制作了机器人
Do you think that kid made that robot by himself really,

900
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,870
还是说他的父母有帮忙
or did his parents help him?

901
00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:50,080
这他妈怎么回事  海伦
What the fuck, Helen?

902
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:51,680
你上哪去了
No, where were you?

903
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,200
我不知道你他妈在玩什么把戏
I don't know what kind of sick game you're fucking playing here,

904
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,720
但那些也是我的孩子
but those are my kids, too,

905
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,460
如果你再试图把我挡在他们的生活之外
and if you ever try to box me out of their lives again--

906
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:57,900
我把你挡在他们的生活之外
Box you out of their lives?

907
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:59,180
你自己不来  这突然就成了我的错
You didn't show up, and suddenly it's my fault?

908
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:00,860
你他妈没把我的名字写到名单上
You didn't put my name on the fucking list.

909
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:01,950
什么名单  我根本不知道
What list? I don't even know--

910
00:49:01,950 --> 00:49:04,950
停  够了  你们的孩子过来了
Okay, stop. That's enough. Your kids are coming, guys,

911
00:49:04,950 --> 00:49:06,210
你们打算怎么做
so what do you want to do?

912
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:08,130
我们要怎么处理此事
How do we want to play this?

913
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:17,010
你是说你觉得
You're saying you actually think the producers

914
00:49:17,010 --> 00:49:19,430
《开心窝》的制片人愿意让你
of Fun Home would give you the rights

915
00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:21,230
导演一个学生作品
to direct a student production?

916
00:49:21,230 --> 00:49:23,690
没错  我和布鲁克林
Yeah. Me and Brooklyn.

917
00:49:24,090 --> 00:49:25,190
你觉得我做不了吗
You think I can't do it?

918
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:26,860
我知道你能做到
I know you can do it.

919
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:30,260
但关键是你要说服制片人
It's just a matter of your convincing the producers.

920
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:31,480
老实说  人家又不认识你
Because, really, who are you?

921
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:33,200
你只是个小毛孩
You're just some kid.

922
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,900
我有些好想法
I have good ideas.

923
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:37,190
所以你可以先试着说服我
So practice your pitch on me first.

924
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:39,240
这些人只给你一次机会
You only get one chance with these people.

925
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:41,120
我可以告诉你需要改进的地方
I can tell you the parts that need work.

926
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:42,330
你真的愿意帮我吗
You would do that?

927
00:49:42,330 --> 00:49:43,500
你首先得和我预约时间
You have to make an appointment first.

928
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:44,650
我可是大忙人
I'm a very busy person.

929
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:45,710
好的  好的
Okay, okay.

930
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:47,570
我会让布鲁克林的妈妈给你妈打电话预约
I'll have Brooklyn's mom call your mom.

931
00:49:47,570 --> 00:49:48,680
这就可以了
That'll be fine.

932
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:49,610
好
Yeah.

933
00:49:50,710 --> 00:49:52,940
跟你们说  我...
You know, I, um...

934
00:49:53,070 --> 00:49:56,150
我真的非常喜欢布鲁克林
I really like Brooklyn a lot.

935
00:49:59,350 --> 00:50:00,880
我知道你喜欢他
Yeah, I know you do.

936
00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:06,830
我为你感到高兴
And I'm really glad.

937
00:50:07,950 --> 00:50:10,290
我觉得维克也为你感到高兴
And I think Vik is glad about that, too.

938
00:50:13,170 --> 00:50:14,120
其实
You know...

939
00:50:15,210 --> 00:50:17,360
我想和你们
if I can be honest

940
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:18,460
坦诚相待
with you guys,

941
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:21,850
有时我觉得我可能是...
sometimes I think I might be...

942
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:24,050
天呐  不好意思我迟到了
Oh, God. So sorry I'm late.

943
00:50:24,050 --> 00:50:26,530
堵车真他妈糟心  天呐
This fucking traffic. Jesus.

944
00:50:26,530 --> 00:50:28,800
这瓶酒给我吧  记到我们的账上
Oh, can I take that? Put that on our tab.

945
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:29,700
谢谢
Thanks.

946
00:50:30,150 --> 00:50:32,390
你好  小家伙  你还好吧
Hey, little man. You okay?

947
00:50:32,390 --> 00:50:33,830
你们在说些什么
What were you talking about?

948
00:50:34,050 --> 00:50:35,020
没什么
Nothing.

949
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:36,810
-你好  爸  -你好
- Hi, Dad. - Hi.

950
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:40,590
我能跟你谈谈吗
Can I talk to you?

951
00:50:56,350 --> 00:50:57,360
有什么事
What's going on?

952
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:58,240
马丁今天给我打电话
Martin called me today.

953
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,140
你忘记给他充饭卡了
You forgot to fill his food card.

954
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:01,880
这个月归我管吗
Is it my month?

955
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:03,650
-我很抱歉  -我真的很努力了
- I'm sorry. - You know, I am really trying,

956
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:06,480
但你他妈又不是世界的中心  诺亚
but you are not the center of the fucking universe, Noah.

957
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,230
我的天呐  海伦  别又来了
Oh, for fuck's sake, Helen, not this again.

958
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:09,970
你知道你刚刚闯入什么了吗
Do you know what you just blundered into out there

959
00:51:09,970 --> 00:51:12,250
像个...像个冲进瓷器店的蛮牛一样
like a... like a bull in a china shop?

960
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:17,040
特雷弗当时准备告诉我们他是同性恋
Trevor was about to tell us he's gay.

961
00:51:18,370 --> 00:51:19,410
-什么  -没错
- What? - Yes.

962
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:21,570
我...  我很肯定
I-I-I'm... I'm pretty sure

963
00:51:21,570 --> 00:51:25,040
他准备告诉维克和我他觉得自己是同性恋
he was about to tell Vik and me that he thinks he's gay.

964
00:51:25,890 --> 00:51:27,510
好吧
Well, okay.

965
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:28,640
好样的
Good for him.

966
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:29,600
我们替他高兴  对吧
We're happy for him, right?

967
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:30,720
没错  我们当然替他高兴
Yes, of course we're happy for him.

968
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:33,170
我就是想让他亲口告诉我们
I just wanted him to be able to tell us.

969
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:35,250
就像他刚刚要做的那样  然后你突然出现
Which he was trying to do, and then you showed up.

970
00:51:35,250 --> 00:51:36,760
好吧  我当时不知情
Okay, well, I didn't know.

971
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,210
所以我们回去坐好  或许他会...
So let's go back out there, and maybe he'll--

972
00:51:38,210 --> 00:51:39,740
不  你还看不懂刚才的情况吗
No, don't you see what happened?

973
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:41,660
你走进来  他就不说话了
You walk in, and he just shuts down.

974
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:43,630
你进来  带来怒气  满嘴脏话
And you come in, and you're angry, and you're swearing,

975
00:51:43,630 --> 00:51:45,150
随手拿起啤酒  吃着薯片
and you're grabbing beers, you're eating chips and--

976
00:51:45,150 --> 00:51:47,140
这可是家墨西哥餐馆
It's a Mexican restaurant.

977
00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:49,220
他怕你
He is intimidated by you.

978
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:51,130
-你在胡扯  -他不敢告诉你
- That's ridiculous. - He's afraid to tell you.

979
00:51:51,130 --> 00:51:52,860
如果他和我多花点时间相处
Well, maybe if he spent more time with me--

980
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:54,660
他担心你会认为这是你造成的
He's afraid you're gonna think it's your fault.

981
00:51:54,670 --> 00:51:55,590
我为什么会觉得这是我的错
Why would I think it's my fault?

982
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,410
因为这就是你的错
Because it is.

983
00:51:57,410 --> 00:52:00,080
什么  特雷弗是同性恋是我的错
What? Trevor being gay is my fault.

984
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:00,730
别说话  闭嘴
No. Shut up.

985
00:52:00,730 --> 00:52:02,110
-我没这么说  -你就是这么说的
- That's not what I said. - It is what you said.

986
00:52:02,110 --> 00:52:03,040
好吧  我不是这个意思
Well, it's not what I meant.

987
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,930
那你是什么意思  海伦
Well, what the fuck did you mean, Helen?

988
00:52:05,090 --> 00:52:06,050
我...
I...

989
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:07,400
你这么想吗
Is that what you think?

990
00:52:07,410 --> 00:52:08,570
如果你真的这么想
If that's what you really think,

991
00:52:08,570 --> 00:52:11,060
那你对人如何成为同性恋的想法
then you've got really weird ideas

992
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:12,980
还真是别出心裁
about how people become gay.

993
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:15,620
天呐  是你
Oh, my God, it's you.

994
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:19,830
你就是地震
You're the earthquake.

995
00:52:19,830 --> 00:52:20,880
我是什么
I'm the what?

996
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:22,980
你就是问题所在
You're the other fucking shoe.

997
00:52:24,150 --> 00:52:26,590
你就是我永远无法放松的原因
You're the reason why I can never ever relax.

998
00:52:26,590 --> 00:52:28,230
因为我每次见到你
Because every time I see you,

999
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:31,560
我就在等着下次灾难的降临
I am just waiting for the next disaster to happen.

1000
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:35,090
天呐  海伦
Jesus Christ, Helen.

1001
00:52:37,550 --> 00:52:39,630
你这说法对我有点不公平  你不觉得吗
That's a little unfair to me, don't you think?

1002
00:52:43,270 --> 00:52:44,690
我不觉得
No, I don't.

1003
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:52,240
数年前  这个家被你拆散
You know, years ago, you broke our family apart,

1004
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:56,060
现在我在新地方总算有了新生活
and now I finally have a new life in a new place.

1005
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:59,150
唯一的问题是你还牵涉其中
The only problem is you're still in it.

1006
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:04,100
你想让我怎么做  海伦
Well, what do you want me to do, Helen?

1007
00:53:05,030 --> 00:53:06,550
不见我的孩子吗
Not see my kids?

1008
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:08,210
因为那是不可能的
'Cause that's not gonna happen.

1009
00:53:08,210 --> 00:53:09,660
不  这我懂
No, I understand.

1010
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:15,700
我...
I...

1011
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:20,630
我觉得我们彼此应该尽可能的
I think we should just try to stay away from each other

1012
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:22,230
保持距离
as much as possible.

1013
00:53:28,310 --> 00:53:29,190
好的
Okay.

1014
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:34,090
好的
Okay.

1015
00:54:30,150 --> 00:54:32,310
再玩五分钟  已经很晚了  好吗
Five more minutes. It's pretty late, okay?

1016
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:33,940
-好的  妈妈  -好的  晚安
- Okay, Mom. - Okay, good night.

1017
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:34,830
晚安
Good night.

1018
00:54:46,590 --> 00:54:49,600
我在想或许我们该休息几天...
I was thinking maybe we could take a few days and...

1019
00:54:50,110 --> 00:54:51,620
去大瑟尔一趟
go up to Big Sur.

1020
00:54:50,110 --> 00:54:51,620
{\an8}美国加利福尼亚风景区

1021
00:54:52,350 --> 00:54:53,510
我还没去过
I've never been there.

1022
00:54:53,950 --> 00:54:56,250
听说那里就像  人间天堂
It's supposed to be, like, God's country.

1023
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:58,010
听着很糟糕
Huh. Sounds awful.

1024
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:00,710
好啊
Yeah.

1025
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:02,340
我把计划调整一下
I'll switch some things around,

1026
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:03,780
来空出一个周末
try to clear a weekend.

1027
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:06,790
我很想和你独处几天
I'd love to have you to myself for a few days.

1028
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:13,750
我觉得我真的开始明白
You know, I think I'm actually starting to

1029
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:17,850
人们为何喜欢洛杉矶了
understand why people like L.A.

1030
00:55:22,190 --> 00:55:23,620
你有什么看法
What do you think about that?

1031
00:55:25,910 --> 00:55:26,760
维克
Vik.

1032
00:55:27,630 --> 00:55:28,620
维克
Vik!
